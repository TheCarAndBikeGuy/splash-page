# splash-page
For this splash-page we had to create a business card on our webpage. It was very fun to complete and understand how all the CSS and HTML work together. I recently put together a rough sketch on Figma to get more practice with it, you can view that here https://www.figma.com/board/IkpUZo2Cr1HoPeeOFhRLfu/Splash-Page?node-id=0-1&t=y9BtkGJbtVToLVLZ-1
